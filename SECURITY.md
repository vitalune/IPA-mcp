# Security and Privacy Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive security and privacy measures implemented in the Personal Knowledge Assistant MCP Server project.

## Overview

The security implementation follows industry best practices and compliance requirements including GDPR, CCPA, and SOC 2 Type II controls. All security measures are designed with "privacy by design" principles and defense in depth strategies.

## Implemented Security Features

### 1. Encryption and Cryptography

#### Data Encryption at Rest
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM with authenticated encryption
- **Alternative**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 for performance-critical scenarios

- **Salt Generation**: Cryptographically secure 32-byte salts per encryption operation
- **File Integrity**: SHA-256 checksums for all encrypted files

#### Key Management
- **Master Key**: 256-bit encryption key derived from user-provided secret
