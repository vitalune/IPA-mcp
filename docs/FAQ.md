# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Common questions and answers about the Personal Knowledge Assistant MCP Server.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### What is the Personal Knowledge Assistant?

The Personal Knowledge Assistant (IPA-MCP) is an AI-powered MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that helps you manage, analyze, and gain insights from your personal information across email, social media, documents, and productivity metrics. It integrates with Claude Desktop to provide natural language access to your data.

### How does it integrate with Claude Desktop?

The Personal Knowledge Assistant implements the MCP protocol, allowing it to register as a tool provider for Claude Desktop. Once configured, you can ask Claude natural language questions about your data, and Claude will use the MCP tools to fetch and analyze your information.

### Is my data safe and private?

Yes! The Personal Knowledge Assistant is designed with privacy as a core principle:
- **Local Processing**: Most analysis happens on your machine
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All stored data is encrypted
- **No Cloud Storage**: Your data stays on your devices
- **GDPR Compliant**: Full data export and deletion capabilities
- **Audit Logging**: Complete transparency of data access

### What services can I connect?

Currently supported services:
- **Gmail**: Email search, sending, and analysis
- **Google Drive**: Document search and content analysis  
- **Twitter**: Tweet posting, search, and engagement analytics
- **LinkedIn**: Professional posting and network analysis

Additional services are planned for future releases.

## üí° Usage & Features

### What can I ask the Personal Knowledge Assistant?

You can ask natural language questions like:
- "Analyze my email patterns for the last month"
- "Who are my most frequent contacts and how quickly do we respond to each other?"
- "Create a weekly productivity report with insights"
- "Post an update about our project launch to Twitter and LinkedIn"
- "Show me my social media engagement trends"

### How accurate is the data analysis?

The accuracy depends on several factors:
- **Data Quality**: Clean, complete data produces better insights
- **Time Range**: Longer time periods provide more reliable trends
- **Service Connectivity**: All connected services must be functioning
- **Configuration**: Properly configured scopes and permissions

The system uses established statistical methods and clearly indicates confidence levels in its analysis.

### Can I customize what data is analyzed?

Yes! You can:
- **Configure Service Scopes**: Control which data types are accessed
- **Set Time Ranges**: Focus analysis on specific time periods
- **Filter by Keywords**: Search for specific topics or projects
- **Privacy Controls**: Exclude certain types of content
- **Custom Metrics**: Define your own productivity and goal tracking

### How often is my data updated?

- **Real-time Queries**: Email and social media data is fetched on-demand
- **Cached Results**: Some analysis is cached for performance (default 6 hours)
- **Background Sync**: Optional background updates can be configured
- **Manual Refresh**: You can always request fresh data explicitly

## üîí Privacy & Security

### Where is my data stored?

Your data is stored locally on your machine:
- **Database Location**: `~/.ipa_mcp/data/` (configurable)
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest using AES-256
- **No Cloud Storage**: Data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export it
- **Temporary Cache**: Some data may be temporarily cached for performance

### What permissions does the app need?

The app requests minimal permissions:
- **Gmail**: Read emails, send emails (optional)
- **Google Drive**: Read-only access to files
- **Twitter**: Read tweets, post tweets (optional)
- **LinkedIn**: Read profile, post updates (optional)

You can configure which permissions to grant for each service.

### Can I delete my data?

Yes! You have full control:
- **Individual Service**: Disconnect and delete data for specific services
- **Complete Deletion**: Remove all stored data with one command
- **Partial Deletion**: Delete data older than a specified time period
- **Export First**: Export your data before deletion if desired

### How is my data encrypted?

- **Algorithm**: AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- **Key Management**: Secure key derivation using PBKDF2
- **Transport**: TLS encryption for all API communications
- **Passwords**: Argon2 hashing for authentication credentials

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### The server won't start - what should I check?

1. **Python Version**: Ensure you're using Python 3.9+
2. **Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Configuration**: Validate your `config/config.yaml` file
4. **Permissions**: Check file and directory permissions
5. **Ports**: Ensure port 8080 is available
6. **Logs**: Check `~/.ipa_mcp/logs/` for error messages

### I'm getting "rate limit exceeded" errors

This is normal and expected:
- **Twitter**: 300 requests per 15-minute window
- **Gmail**: Very high limits, rarely reached
- **LinkedIn**: 500 requests per day
- **Solution**: Wait for the rate limit window to reset, or reduce query frequency

### My email analysis shows no data

Possible causes:
1. **Gmail Not Connected**: Check API credentials and authentication
2. **Insufficient Permissions**: Ensure Gmail scopes include `gmail.readonly`
3. **Time Range**: Try a broader time range (e.g., "last 3 months")
4. **Email Volume**: You may not have enough emails in the specified period
5. **Filters**: Check if you're filtering out too much data

### Social media posting isn't working

Check these items:
1. **API Credentials**: Verify Twitter/LinkedIn credentials are correct
2. **Permissions**: Ensure write permissions (`tweet.write`, `w_member_social`)
3. **Content Length**: Check character limits (280 for Twitter, 3000 for LinkedIn)
4. **Rate Limits**: You may have exceeded posting limits
5. **Service Status**: Check if Twitter/LinkedIn APIs are operational

### The analysis results seem incorrect

Verify these factors:
1. **Data Completeness**: Ensure all relevant services are connected
2. **Time Synchronization**: Check system time and time zone settings
3. **Data Quality**: Review source data for completeness and accuracy
4. **Configuration**: Verify analysis parameters and filters
5. **Cache**: Clear cache and retry with fresh data

## üìä Data Analysis

### How does sentiment analysis work?

The system uses natural language processing to analyze the emotional tone of your communications:
- **Algorithm**: Pre-trained models with domain-specific tuning
- **Accuracy**: Generally 80-90% accurate for clear emotional expressions
- **Languages**: Primarily English, with basic support for other languages
- **Context**: Considers context and relationship dynamics

### What does "relationship strength" mean?

Relationship strength is calculated based on:
- **Communication Frequency**: How often you exchange messages
- **Response Patterns**: How quickly you respond to each other
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Balance of who initiates conversations
- **Recency**: How recently you've communicated
- **Content Engagement**: Length and depth of conversations

### How are productivity patterns identified?

The system analyzes:
- **Temporal Patterns**: When you're most active and responsive
- **Work Distribution**: Balance between different types of activities
